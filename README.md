## MY-ci_base

CodeIgniter 3.0-dev installation with lots of stuff I use for bigger projects.
Sorry for stupid name...

This was kinda reverse engineered from a project I recently finished.
So there might still be some crap in it. Sorry.

## Thanks to...

Many thanks to all the guys which made this base CI installation possible. I don't think I could get anything done without the stuff those people created. Ok, I could, I did in the past... but there were good reasons why I choose CodeIgniter and those contributions. Good advice to all devs: Doing everything alone sucks! Work with the community!

And an additional big thank to [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com)! A CMS I really love, and which inspired me to create this base installation. People who use pyroCMS will see that a lot of what is in this CI base, is also in pyroCMS. So yeah, to be honest... I wanted something that feels like pyroCMS when developing, but without the really really really great backend. Dang, that sounds really stupid. But I have my reasons, I swear!

Any yea, I'm totaly a [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com) fanboy. So... [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com) [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com) [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com) [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com). [pyroCMS](http://www.pyrocms.com).
